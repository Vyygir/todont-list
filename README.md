# Todo(n't) List

This is very much just a learning project for me to work on whilst I give Rust a proper go and figure out what I'm doing

You should absolutely, in all ways, manners, shapes, and forms expect low code-quality, not-so-great practices, and potential bugs and issues with the code. I've only left this repository public beacuse I don't see a reason not to have my developments online. We all need to learn so we may as well be open about it.

### Contributions

Please don't.

### Reporting issues

Well, no, obviously don't.

#### License

Feel free to use this code in any open-source and/or commercial products you're developing. Don't come crying to me when some obvious security exploit fucks you over though.
